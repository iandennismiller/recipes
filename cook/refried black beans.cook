Saute @onion{1} in a pot until barely softened, add @chili powder{1%tsp}, @smoked paprika{1%tsp}, @cumin{1%tsp}, @tomato paste{}, and @garlic{2%cloves}.

Deglaze with water, stock, or white wine when fragrant.

Add @black beans{2%cups} to the pot, and top with water until covered by about an inch.

Bring to a full boil, reduce to a simmer, then pop a lid on and wait until the beans are the texture you want. Cook time depends on the bean.

Once softened, scrape some beans against the side of the pot to thicken the broth, add @salt{}, taste, and add more seasoning as necessary.
