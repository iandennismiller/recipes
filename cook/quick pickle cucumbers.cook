Inspect several #canning jars{} for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in #pot{} of simmering water until needed. Wash new, unused #lids and #rings in warm soapy water.

Bring @distilled white vinegar{1%cup}, @sugar{1.5%cups}, and @salt{1%tbsp} to a boil in a #medium saucepan{} over medium heat. Boil until sugar dissolves, about 10 minutes.

Place @cucumbers{6%cups}, @sliced onions{1%cup}, and @peppers{1%cup} into a #large mixing bowl{}. Pour brine over top and toss vegetables for several minutes.

Transfer vegetables and brine to the sterilized jars; don't worry if the brine doesn't cover the vegetables.
