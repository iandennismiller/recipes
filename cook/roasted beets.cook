To roast @beets set your oven temperature to 425 degrees F.

Thoroughly wash each beet, drizzle with @olive oil{}, and wrap in foil.

Transfer the beets to a large baking sheet and allow them to roast until tender, approximately 45-60 minutes.

Remove beets from the oven, carefully remove foil, and allow your beets to cool before peeling away the skin.

Rinse with cold water and store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
