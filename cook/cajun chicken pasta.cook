>> Skillet note: Avoid using cast iron or copper pans anytime you are making a creamy sauce with an acidic product like tomato or it will react and make the sauce grainy.
>> Salt note: If you are using a cajun seasoning that has a high salt content, start with half of the seasoning and add more to taste.
