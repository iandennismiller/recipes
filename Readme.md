# Recipes

These are "my" recipes; I've collected and transcribed them.

These recipes are not mine; they are yours.

## Recipe Provenance

I once watched a cooking video of a village making curry in an enormous, elephant-sized pot.
The videomaker asked one of the cooks: whose recipe is this?
The cook was puzzled by this question but, pressed for answers, said it was the guru's.
However, it wasn't the guru's either.
